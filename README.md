# Welcome to SUPrem Template

This project was my first CSS3/HTML5 project used as an entry in the InfoEducatie Contest in 2012.

## Parallax - A new big thing at that time

One of the main features of this website is Parallax style used by implementing a lot of functions for determining the position of objects, computing offsets of the objects etc.
